        <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
            <h3>Bread Dough</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
                    <li>1.00 cup whole fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
                    <il>¼ teaspoon granulated garlic</il>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Garlic Topping:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic granules</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
            <p>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; mix to combine.</p>
            <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
            <p>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. Add more flour (1 teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (such as Silpat®).</p>
            <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
            <p>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.</p>
            <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
            <p><b>Step 6</b></p>
            <p>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.</p>
        <h4>Recipie Tip</h4>
            <p>You can make self-rising flour by adding 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder to all-purpose flour to equal 1 cup.</p>
